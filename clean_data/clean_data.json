Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a banks riskbased capital requirements for credit market and operational risk For Risk Based Capital RBC Credit Usage CU and Stress Test ST the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible If the collateral is ineligible

Protocol IP IP is a packetbased protocol used to exchange data voice and video traffic over digital networks  Ciscos WideArea Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services such as endtoend security quality of service QoS and globally unique addresses The IPv6 address space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation NAT processing by border routers at network edges  Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6 addresses to individual router interfaces The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled  The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP addresses  Mainly involves to checks

Services WAAS is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the performance of applications on a wide area network WAN WAAS combines Ciscos Wide Area File Services WAFSproducts allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN with WAN optimization inside of a router accelerating TCPbased applications on a given network  WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines WAEs that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server  The WAEs examine the traffic and use builtin application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized  Mainly involves optimizing the various Aos like HTTP SSL HTTPS and functional wise platform check

internal customers It has main two planes system management and system service planes and several sub modules I have successfully worked on the following modules  Module  MML INI Parser Tool MML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments This Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands INI Parsing tool is a tool which accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands Involved in the development testing verification of the module on windows    Module  Man Machine Language MML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments It uses ClientServer architecture MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment It receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process it After acquiring the processing result the server generates a MML report and sends it back to the client It interacts with other system modules Connection Management Authorization Management Command Process Data Synchronization Event Notification Command Parsing LOGALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server Involved in the development defect fixing and verification of the module on windows Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities  Module  Configuration Management Configuration Management Module is core module of System Management Its main function is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration tool layer and the application layer and provide related configuration command communication mechanism Any information that can be modified by the userapplication and that affects the functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data All configuration commands can be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type Configuration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be loaded to provide a persistent storage amp retrieval mechanism for applications static configuration data Involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities  Module  TL1 Transaction Language 1 TL1 is a widely used legacy management protocol in telecommunications It is a crossvendor crosstechnology manmachine language and is widely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks SONET  It is defined for operation system network element machinetomachine interfaces TL1 corresponds to the User System Language USL which is the language for humanto machine interactions It is used for managing network elements in a network TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client Client sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications TL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR 831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages back to TL1 Response messages Involved in development verification and customer and release activities I
